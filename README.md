Practice using the CocktailDB API

## What this is...
This is a simple project to test out the capabilities of the [CocktailDB API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php).

## Capabilities
* Typing in a name in the search bar and hitting "Find Your Drink" will display a list of all drinks in the database (up to 100 for free API key) that have that word in Drink Name.

* Typing in an ingredient and hitting "Find Your Drink" will display a list of all drinks in the database (up to 100 for free API key) that have that ingredient in the drink.

* More to come!
